A small version of the AWK utility. 

I've decided to go with ANTLR4 to create this. 
It will make things a lot easier.   

Acknowledgement - A big "thanks" to Github users bkiers (who 
wrote "tiny-language-antlr4") and "mateiw" (who wrote 
"littlebasic"). I will be using grammar code from both of 
those projects. It will be very useful as I build up the  
miniAWK grammar. 
Thanks to both of you for writing those apps and for 
releasing them as "public domain"!  
 

miniAWK is (of course) "public domain".   
"Share and enjoy".......  :)
