 ***  README - miniAWK *** 

Last update - 1st Mar 2018.  

Status - making good progress with grammar. 
Not yet working. 


A small version of the AWK utility. 

I've decided to go with ANTLR4 to create this. 
It will make things a lot easier.   

Acknowledgement - A big "thanks" to Github user "mateiw" - 
he write the "littlebasic" language from which I grabbed 
some of the ANTLR grammar for miniAWK and miniFPL. 
Thanks for writing that, mateiw, and for releasing it as 
"public domain"!  
 
miniAWK is (of course) "public domain".   
"Share and enjoy".......  :)
